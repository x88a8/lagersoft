Easy to use Shelf Management Software, to never let something expire again. Expandable to many more things than just Food. 
One windows device + bluetooth /USB barcode scanner required (for usage with food). Other devices to access database must be connected to same intranet and can be virtually any OS.

To use on a Windows device (f.ex. Tablet).

A Web server to host the table of whats availible, in what quantity and when it expires.
A Java Program to add new products using a USB/Bluetooth Barcode Scanner.

Future:
  - Phone App (Simple Web App, that displays the Website, and if outside of Intranet, displays last saved status of page)
  - Language options to choose from
  - Alerts for when products expire. (maybe Pushbullet?)
  - option to disable accessibility over intranet. (just local on that device)
